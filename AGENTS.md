# Project Rules

## Non-Goals

This project is **not**:

- a general-purpose network management framework
- a UniFi controller replacement or admin dashboard
- a real-time monitoring or alerting service
- a CI/CD pipeline runner or deployment tool
- a web application with a frontend UI (dev consoles are debugging REPLs only)
- a database or persistent storage layer (all state lives on UniFi controllers)

## Architecture Rules

### Layering

- Tool functions MUST NOT contain business logic beyond argument validation and response formatting
- Tool functions MUST delegate to manager methods for all controller interactions
- Manager methods MUST NOT import from `<app>.tools` (no circular dependencies)
- All controller communication MUST flow through `ConnectionManager`
- Tool modules MUST import singletons from `<app>.runtime`, never instantiate directly
- Shared packages MUST NOT import from app packages (dependency flows downward only)
- App packages MUST NOT import from each other (no cross-app dependencies)

### Singletons

- All shared objects (server, config, managers) MUST be created via `@lru_cache` factories in `<app>/runtime.py`
- Tests MUST monkey-patch the factory or alias before importing tool modules
- There MUST be exactly one `ConnectionManager` instance per server process

### Tool Response Contract

All tools MUST return `Dict[str, Any]`:

```python
{"success": True, "data": <result>}                                    # Success
{"success": False, "error": "<specific, actionable message>"}          # Error
{"success": True, "requires_confirmation": True, "preview": <payload>} # Mutation preview
```

- Exceptions MUST NOT escape tool functions. Catch, log with `exc_info=True`, return error dict.
- Error messages MUST include the operation that failed (e.g., `"Failed to list devices: ..."` not just `str(e)`).
- Raw tracebacks MUST NOT be exposed to MCP clients.

### Confirmation System

All state-changing tools MUST implement preview-then-confirm:
- `confirm=False` (default): validate input, return preview payload
- `confirm=True`: execute the mutation on the controller
- Bypass mode injects `confirm=True` automatically
- **Anchor:** `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/confirmation.py`

### MCP Tool Annotations

All tools MUST include `annotations=ToolAnnotations(...)` in `@server.tool()`:
- Read-only: `readOnlyHint=True, openWorldHint=False`
- Mutating: `readOnlyHint=False, destructiveHint=<bool>, idempotentHint=<bool>, openWorldHint=False`
- `destructiveHint=True` for delete, block, reboot, revoke operations
- `idempotentHint=True` for update/rename (same args = same result)
- All tools: `openWorldHint=False` (closed UniFi controller domain)

### Async

- All I/O-bound operations MUST use `async`/`await`
- No synchronous blocking calls in tool implementations or managers
- `asyncio.run()` MUST NOT be called from within an async context

### Logging

- Network client/device managers and tools log operation context and exception class only; never log MAC/IP addresses, names, update payloads, exception messages, or tracebacks. This is a narrow privacy exception to the ordinary tool `exc_info=True` rule because controller exceptions can embed those values.
- Network connection authentication/refresh failure logs and system settings update failure logs follow the same operation-and-exception-class pattern. Do not log sanitized exception text or controller response bodies at these boundaries: configured/submitted-secret scrubbing cannot cover controller-only secrets or opaque exception renderers.
- Carry this privacy rule through the auto-backup settings read/preview/update and DPI refresh caller chains, including manager logs and MCP error responses. Catching a safely logged but re-raised exception must not reintroduce its message or traceback.
- Cached Network authentication failures contain exception class and fixed guidance only, since later tool calls may log them. ConnectionManager settings request failure logs omit controller text and tracebacks before the exception reaches a domain manager.
- ConnectionManager translates failed `/get/setting/` and `/set/setting/` requests into a new `RequestError` with fixed operation context and the original exception class, suppressing original traceback context. This protects all settings callers, including those that log the received exception.
- StatsManager DPI refresh failures use the same safe-error translation before leaving the core manager; REST and GraphQL bypass the MCP tool wrapper.
- ConnectionManager handler refresh failures are translated to safe RequestError instances after reauthentication/circuit handling. All collection callers, including clients and devices, must receive safe text and suppressed original traceback context.

- All log output MUST go to stderr (stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC in stdio mode)
- Use `%s` format strings in logger calls, not f-strings, for lazy evaluation
- Configuration errors SHOULD fail fast at startup with clear guidance
- Privacy-boundary support-bundle code is the narrow exception to the ordinary tool `exc_info=True` rule: it MUST NOT log the original exception, traceback, arguments, raw collected payload, or returned bundle. It may log only fixed allowlisted fields such as probe enum, normalized error category, duration bucket, and an independently generated correlation ID.

### Hard Bans

- Hardcoding host, port, credentials, or feature flags in Python source is **banned** — use `config.yaml` with `${oc.env:VAR,default}` or `UNIFI_`-prefixed env vars
- Permission category strings MUST be defined in `<app>/categories.py` (`NETWORK_CATEGORY_MAP`, etc.)
- Tool-to-module mappings MUST be in `TOOL_MODULE_MAP` in `<app>/categories.py`
- Product-specific validation models MUST be pydantic BaseModel classes in `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/<server>/models/<domain>.py` — never inline JSON schema dicts in tool functions or app-local schemas modules
- Cross-product privacy contracts that use one discriminated schema for Network, Protect, and Access MUST remain a single closed model in a dedicated root `unifi-core` domain module (currently `unifi_core/support_bundle.py`); do not duplicate that contract under each server
- No monkey-patches in production code
- One-shot support probes MUST use the request-scoped middleware in `unifi_core/support_transport.py` to prevent aiohttp's internal GET retry. Never toggle shared-session retry settings; keep transport behavior out of the pure support-bundle privacy kernel.
- **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/config/config.yaml`

### API Surface Boundaries

UniFi exposes three API surfaces with disjoint ID/auth models: the V2 controller API (session cookie auth, Mongo ObjectIDs, `snake_case` fields), the public Integration API (`X-API-Key` auth, UUIDs, `camelCase` fields), and the UniFi-OS **Alarm Manager v2** service (`/api/v2/alarms/`, session + **SuperAdmin** auth, UUIDs, `snake_case` fields). They are **not interchangeable**.

Authentication credentials and API surfaces are separate concepts. Network 10.6.106
also accepts API keys on verified legacy inventory GET endpoints, preserving legacy
IDs and fields. Detect that capability at runtime; do not assume it on every
controller or infer write/websocket support from successful reads.

### Authentication routing golden path

- ConnectionManagers own credential availability and transport selection. Reuse
  the shared authentication status contract in `unifi_core.auth`; retain each
  product's SDK/lifecycle implementation.
- Network preserves working session behavior when both credentials are configured;
  Access retains its existing per-operation preference. A failed session must not
  block an independently usable API-key path. Protect public setters still require
  session bootstrap, so they are not an independent key-only startup path.
- Choose a route before an operation. Never replay an uncertain mutation using
  another credential or API surface. Require a session for unvalidated key-backed
  legacy writes, including direct SDK callers.
- Keep tool auth metadata accurate (`local_only`, `api_key_only`, `either`, or
  `both`); describe field-dependent requirements. Metadata is discovery, not
  enforcement. Core manager checks apply equally to MCP and REST/GraphQL/actions.
- Public-only inventory must label its source and incomplete field/collection
  coverage. Do not fabricate legacy IDs or default unknown values to false/zero.
  Preserve MAC-based identity where verified; public UUIDs are separate fields.
- Anchors: Access `ConnectionManager.initialize` and `DoorManager.list_doors`;
  Protect `require_public_api_key` and `validate_public_id_portability`.

### API tool families

- **Tool families share an ID space.** Tools whose returned IDs and accepted IDs are mutually portable form a *family*. Cross-family ID use is prohibited.
- **Tool descriptions MUST scope IDs** when they could be confused with another family's IDs. Standard formula: *"These IDs are scoped to the <family> tool family — do not pass them to other <resource> tools."* This applies to MCP tool descriptions, GraphQL type/query descriptions, and REST route descriptions alike.
- **Integration API tools MUST require an API key** and fail with a clear remediation message when it is missing. The auth check belongs in the manager so every tool in the family inherits it.
- **Alarm Manager v2 (`/api/v2/alarms/`) requires a SuperAdmin credential.** Reach it via `uiprotect`'s `api_request(..., api_path="/api/v2/alarms/")` (no bespoke client). A Protect-scoped account returns 403 — managers MUST map this to an actionable "requires SuperAdmin" error so callers/agents self-diagnose. Blast radius is topology-dependent: broad on a combined UDM console, contained to Protect on a standalone UNVR.
- **Silent cross-API ID translation is banned** unless the mapping is 1:1, stable, and verified against live data. Zones are grandfathered (1:1 by name, stable, unique). Policies are not (membership diverges, no bridge field, V2 has duplicate names).
- **Bridging tools must be explicit.** If you need to cross ID namespaces, write a named bridging tool (`unifi_resolve_<resource>_id_for_<family>`) with documented failure modes. Never bury the bridge inside another tool.

**Enforcement:** family scoping is currently *guidance* — descriptions + this rule. There is no runtime or type-level check. Cross-family ID misuse fails at the controller (e.g., 400 from the integration API) and surfaces as a tool error. Stronger enforcement (typed IDs, runtime regex checks, manifest family field) is on the table if and when the integration-API surface grows beyond the current single family.

**Reference family (Integration API):** `unifi_get_firewall_policy_ordering` + `unifi_reorder_firewall_policies` in `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/firewall.py`.

**Skill:** `add-integration-api-tool` (full procedure for contributors).

## Permission System

Two concepts:

**Permission Mode** — controls mutation handling:
- `confirm` (default): mutations require preview-then-confirm
- `bypass`: mutations execute without confirmation
- Read-only tools are always allowed

Env var precedence (most specific wins): `UNIFI_<SERVER>_TOOL_PERMISSION_MODE` > `UNIFI_TOOL_PERMISSION_MODE`

**Policy Gates** — hard boundaries that disable actions:

Three-level hierarchy (most specific wins): `UNIFI_POLICY_<SERVER>_<CATEGORY>_<ACTION>` > `UNIFI_POLICY_<SERVER>_<ACTION>` > `UNIFI_POLICY_<ACTION>`

Actions: `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. Unset = allowed.

All tools MUST remain visible and discoverable regardless of policy gates. Authorization is checked at call time by the `permissioned_tool` decorator.

- **Anchor:** `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/policy_gate.py`

## Golden Paths

All changes MUST follow a golden path. If no path applies, ask before inventing a new pattern.

### Add a new tool to an existing category

1. Add manager method in `apps/<server>/src/<pkg>/managers/<domain>_manager.py`
   - **Anchor (read-only):** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/managers/client_manager.py`
   - **Anchor (mutating):** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/managers/firewall_manager.py`
2. Add tool function in `apps/<server>/src/<pkg>/tools/<category>.py`
   - **Anchor (read-only):** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/clients.py:lookup_by_ip`
   - **Anchor (mutating):** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/firewall.py:create_firewall_policy`
3. Add tool name to `TOOL_MODULE_MAP` in `<pkg>/categories.py`
4. Run `make manifest`
5. Add tests in `apps/<server>/tests/unit/test_<category>.py`
6. Add `ToolAnnotations` to the `@server.tool()` decorator
7. Commit code + manifest + tests together

### Add a new tool category

1. Create manager: `apps/<server>/src/<pkg>/managers/<domain>_manager.py`
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/managers/routing_manager.py`
2. Add `@lru_cache` factory + alias in `<pkg>/runtime.py`
3. Create tool module: `apps/<server>/src/<pkg>/tools/<category>.py`
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/clients.py`
4. Add tool names to `TOOL_MODULE_MAP` in `<pkg>/categories.py`
5. Add category to the server's `CATEGORY_MAP` in `<pkg>/categories.py`
6. Run `make manifest`
7. Add tests, update docs and README as needed
8. Commit everything together

### Add a configuration value

1. Add default to `apps/<server>/src/<pkg>/config/config.yaml` with `${oc.env:VAR,default}` syntax
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/config/config.yaml`
2. Add env var to `.env.example` with a comment
3. Document in README.md configuration section

### Add or modify an update tool

Update tools MUST use the fetch-merge-put pattern. The manager fetches current state, merges the caller's partial updates, and PUTs the full object. The tool layer accepts a partial dict, validates via the domain's pydantic model (`<Model>.to_controller_update`), and shows a before/after preview.

1. Manager method: fetch existing → copy → merge updates → PUT full object
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/managers/network_manager.py:update_network`
2. Define or extend the pydantic model in `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/<server>/models/<domain>.py`. Mark mutable fields as such (default mutability); read-only fields use `json_schema_extra={"mutable": False}`.
3. Tool function: validate the caller's partial dict via `<Model>.to_controller_update(fields)`, fetch current state for preview, use `update_preview`.
   - **Anchor (model):** `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/network/models/wlans.py`
   - **Anchor (tool):** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/wlans.py:update_wlan`
5. Tool description MUST include: "Pass only the fields you want to change — current values are automatically preserved."
6. Run `make manifest`
7. Add tests covering: partial merge preserves unmentioned fields, not-found returns False, empty update is a no-op

### Add or migrate a domain to shared field models

When a tool domain has list/create/update tools, define a shared pydantic model as the single source of truth for field names, types, and mutability. This ensures list output field names are always accepted by create/update tools — preventing silent data loss when callers round-trip fields from list output into create/update calls.

1. Create model in `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/<server>/models/<domain>.py`
   - One `BaseModel` class with all fields (mutable + read-only)
   - Read-only fields marked with `json_schema_extra={"mutable": False}`
   - Export `MUTABLE_FIELDS` and `READ_ONLY_FIELDS` frozensets
   - Co-locate translation helpers: `from_controller(raw)`, `to_controller_create(model)`, `to_controller_update(fields)`
   - Models live in `unifi-core` so both the MCP tool layer and the API server can import them
   - **Anchor:** `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/network/models/acl.py`
2. Refactor tool functions to derive I/O from the model
   - List/get tools: `from_controller(raw).model_dump()`
   - Create tool: build model from params → `to_controller_create()` → manager
   - Update tool: validate keys against `MUTABLE_FIELDS`, translate via `to_controller_update()` → manager
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools/acl.py`
3. Manager layer is unchanged — continues to speak the controller API dialect
4. Add a field symmetry test asserting every mutable field is a create param
   - **Anchor:** `apps/network/tests/unit/test_acl_tools.py:TestListAclRules.test_list_and_create_field_symmetry`
5. Register the `(server, domain)` pair in the cross-layer symmetry test
   - The matching Strawberry type at `unifi_api.graphql.types.<server>.<domain>` must expose every pydantic `MUTABLE_FIELDS` name with a compatible type annotation
   - This catches MCP↔API drift at PR time
   - **Anchor:** `apps/api/tests/unit/test_cross_layer_symmetry.py`
6. **If the change touches the API surface** (a Strawberry type, resolver field, REST route, or serializer), regenerate the API artifacts. These are **NOT** produced by `make manifest` — there is no make target for them, so it is easy to miss and the drift gates then fail at PR time:
   - `apps/api/src/unifi_api/graphql/schema.graphql` (GraphQL SDL), `apps/api/openapi.json`, and **both** docgen reference docs `apps/api/docs/graphql-reference.md` AND `apps/api/docs/openapi-reference.md` (the REST-endpoint reference)
   - Regen: SDL via `print(str(schema))`; openapi via `app.openapi()`; **both reference docs at once** via `python -m unifi_api.graphql.docgen` (it writes graphql-reference.md AND openapi-reference.md — calling only `render_reference()` misses the REST one). Exact commands are in the drift gates' docstrings (`apps/api/tests/graphql/test_sdl_drift.py`, `test_openapi_drift.py`, `test_docs_drift.py`)
7. Run `make manifest`
8. Commit model + refactored tools + tests together

### Modify the permission system

1. Shared logic: `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/policy_gate.py`
2. Server-specific categories: `CATEGORY_MAP` in the app's `categories.py`
3. Enforcement: `permissioned_tool` decorator in the app's `main.py`
4. Policy gates configured via `UNIFI_POLICY_*` env vars (no config.yaml section)
5. Tests in `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/tests/` and `apps/<server>/tests/unit/`

### Add shared functionality

1. Choose package: `unifi-core` (controller abstractions, no MCP dependency) or `unifi-mcp-shared` (MCP utilities)
2. Add module to `packages/<pkg>/src/<pkg_name>/`
3. Add tests in `packages/<pkg>/tests/`
4. Run `make core-test` or `make shared-test`

## Quality Gates

A change is not done unless ALL pass:

```bash
make pre-commit   # format + lint + sync-skills + test
```

### Tool Changes Checklist

- [ ] Follows anchor pattern (thin wrapper, delegates to manager)
- [ ] Returns standardized `{"success": bool, ...}` response
- [ ] Added to `TOOL_MODULE_MAP` in `categories.py`
- [ ] `make manifest` run and manifest committed
- [ ] If the change touches the API surface (Strawberry type / resolver / route / serializer): `apps/api/src/unifi_api/graphql/schema.graphql`, `apps/api/openapi.json`, and BOTH docgen docs `apps/api/docs/graphql-reference.md` + `apps/api/docs/openapi-reference.md` (run `python -m unifi_api.graphql.docgen` to regenerate both) regenerated and committed — NOT covered by `make manifest`; the `test_sdl_drift` / `test_openapi_drift` / `test_docs_drift` gates enforce them
- [ ] Mutating tools implement preview-then-confirm
- [ ] Tools returning raw controller secrets redact at the boundary according to response policy (see Response redaction pattern)
- [ ] Permission category and action set via decorator kwargs
- [ ] `ToolAnnotations` added
- [ ] Tests cover success, error, and permission denial paths
- [ ] Works in all three registration modes (lazy, eager, meta_only)

### Configuration Changes Checklist

- [ ] Default in `config.yaml` with `${oc.env:VAR,default}`
- [ ] `.env.example` updated
- [ ] README.md configuration table updated

### Version and Manifest Rules

- Version is derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs`. MUST NOT manually edit version in `pyproject.toml`.
- Before release tags, update downstream `pyproject.toml` dependency ranges when a downstream package requires newly tagged `unifi-core` or `unifi-mcp-shared` code; pip only installs versions allowed by the published wheel metadata.
- Each app's `tools_manifest.json` MUST be regenerated (`make manifest`) and committed before release.
- The Cloudflare worker lives in `apps/worker/` as a self-contained Node/TypeScript app. It is intentionally excluded from the uv workspace and released from `worker/v*` tags via npm; run `make worker-check` for focused worker changes and root `make check` before merging worker or relay protocol changes.

## Patterns

### Silent-drop mitigation (#138)

All three app servers run on `StrictKwargFastMCP` (a `FastMCP` subclass in `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/strict_dispatch.py`) that intercepts incoming `tools/call` requests and rejects unknown top-level kwargs against `tools_manifest.json` BEFORE pydantic's `extra="ignore"` can silently drop them. Schema-dict drops (free-form `*_data` dicts) are independently caught by `additionalProperties: false` from #206. Do not bypass this wrapper; do not patch FastMCP internals to achieve the same effect. The wrapper retires when upstream lands `extra="forbid"` on FastMCP's tool arg models — at that point `StrictKwargFastMCP` becomes a no-op guard and can be removed cleanly.

- **Anchor:** `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/strict_dispatch.py`

### Response redaction (#348)

Secret-bearing response fields are redacted at egress boundaries, NOT in domain models — `from_controller` and friends carry real values. Sensitivity is decided by key name in `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/redaction.py` (`is_sensitive_key` / `redact_sensitive_fields` / `redact_value`); policy is resolved centrally by `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/policy.py` (`should_redact_sensitive_fields`) and exposed to MCP apps through `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/response_policy.py`. Redact once per surface — MCP tool returns, the REST serializer, GraphQL types, SSE frames, and diagnostics — using `redact_sensitive=True` by default. Raw secret values are enabled only by response policy (`UNIFI_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false` or a server-specific override such as `UNIFI_NETWORK_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, `UNIFI_PROTECT_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, `UNIFI_ACCESS_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`, or `UNIFI_API_REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=false`); do not add per-tool/request opt-out arguments. Redacted values surface as the marker `***REDACTED***`; write-back of the marker is rejected centrally in `StrictKwargFastMCP.call_tool` (MCP) and `dispatch_action` (API) — do NOT add per-tool marker checks.

- **Anchor:** `packages/unifi-core/src/unifi_core/redaction.py`

### Extension Over Patching

- Prefer adding new tool modules and managers over modifying existing ones
- New tool categories get their own manager + tool module (vertical slice)
- Fix root causes, not symptoms

### Conflict Resolution

- Consult the anchor files in Golden Paths when unsure which pattern to follow
- If no anchor applies, ask before inventing a new pattern
- If adopting a genuinely new pattern, update this rules file first

### Plan First

Before non-trivial changes, produce a short plan covering: approach, impacted files, which anchors apply, new tests needed, verification steps.

**Skip the plan only when all are true:** single-file edit, no new behavior or tools, no config/permission/schema changes, no new tests.

<!-- myco:managed:start -->
## Myco Managed Guidance

- When `capture.ignore_plan_dirs_in_git` is enabled, custom directories in `capture.plan_dirs` may be intentionally gitignored after capture into Myco.
- Do not force-add files from intentionally gitignored custom plan directories unless the user explicitly asks.
- When orienting in this codebase — finding a feature, locating files relevant to a change, or understanding an unfamiliar subsystem — use Myco first: call `myco tool call myco_cortex --json --input '{"op":"canopy_map"}'` as the CLI path, or `myco_cortex({"op":"canopy_map"})` via MCP when the host exposes Myco tools cleanly, before falling back to Glob/Grep.
