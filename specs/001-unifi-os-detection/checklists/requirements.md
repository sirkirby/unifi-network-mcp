# Specification Quality Checklist: UniFi OS Connection Type Detection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on user value and business outcomes. No implementation details about Python, aiounifi library implementation, or code structure are mentioned. The language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders while remaining precise.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement uses clear MUST language and defines specific, verifiable capabilities. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions have been made with documented assumptions.

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Zero 404 errors (measurable outcome)
- SC-002: Detection within 5 seconds (measurable timing)
- SC-003: 100% correct path prefix (measurable accuracy)
- SC-004: Zero support tickets (measurable business impact)
- SC-005: Max 2 seconds overhead (measurable performance)
- SC-006: 100% manual override success (measurable reliability)
- SC-007: Future compatibility (verifiable through upgrade testing)
- SC-008: 100% actionable error messages (measurable quality)

### Acceptance Scenarios Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All user stories include complete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format covering:
- US1: 4 scenarios covering detection, path application, and error handling
- US2: 4 scenarios covering manual override, invalid config, and fallback
- US3: 4 scenarios covering retry, fallback, error handling, and caching

### Edge Cases Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Six comprehensive edge cases identified:
- Controller upgrades (migration scenario)
- Mixed environments (multi-controller setup)
- Detection endpoint failures (network/firewall issues)
- Future API changes (forward compatibility)
- Library native support (integration concern)
- Partial deployments (hardware variation)

### Scope Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded with three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) that build progressively from core functionality to resilience features. Assumptions section clearly defines what is in and out of scope.

### Dependencies and Assumptions Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Eight documented assumptions (A-001 through A-008) covering:
- Path structure consistency
- Detection mechanism feasibility
- Library capabilities
- Session validity
- Network connectivity
- Configuration precedence

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No clarifications needed as all decisions have reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section. The feature is well-scoped with clear MVP (P1), value-add (P2), and robustness (P3) tiers.

**Updated 2025-10-23**: Added support for dev_console.py testing tool:
- FR-011: dev_console.py compatibility requirement
- A-009: Assumption about shared connection manager
- SC-009: Success criterion for verification via dev_console.py
- Added 2 edge cases about dev_console.py behavior
- Added acceptance scenario 5 to User Story 1 for dev_console.py output

The dev_console.py tool is a shipped diagnostic utility that allows users to test MCP tools in their environment. The detection feature must work transparently with this tool and display detection results during connection initialization for user verification and troubleshooting.

## Next Steps

✅ Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
