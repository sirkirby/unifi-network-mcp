"""MAC address normalization.

The UniFi controller reports MAC addresses in lowercase. Callers supply
whatever they have - and the form printed on a device label, quoted in
vendor documentation, or pasted out of another tool is very often
uppercase. Comparing the two with a raw ``==`` reports "not found" for
hardware that plainly exists, which reads as a broken controller rather
than a case mismatch.

Use :func:`mac_equal` for comparisons rather than normalizing both sides at
each call site: it is the guard against ``None == None`` matching a record
that has no ``mac`` field at all.

**Call pattern at an entry point**, and the trailing ``or`` is not redundant::

    client_mac = normalize_mac(client_mac) or client_mac

:func:`normalize_mac` returns ``None`` for anything unusable, and several
callers interpolate the result straight into a request path - ``f"/stat/
device/{device_mac}"``. Dropping the fallback would send the literal string
``None`` to the controller. With it, an unusable input reproduces the old
behavior exactly (the lookup misses and raises) rather than inventing a new
failure mode. Normalize once, at the entry point, and use the result for the
lookup *and* for anything sent onward - the controller reports lowercase, so
matching a record and then sending a different casing is how a fixed lookup
turns into a request the controller may still reject, later and more quietly.
