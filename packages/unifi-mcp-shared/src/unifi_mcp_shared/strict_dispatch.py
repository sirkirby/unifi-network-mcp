"""StrictKwargFastMCP: transport-layer kwarg validation for FastMCP servers.

FastMCP's ``tools/call`` handler runs incoming ``arguments`` through pydantic
with ``extra="ignore"`` (the default), which silently drops unknown keys.
Result: callers passing typos or stale field names get ``success=True`` from
tools that didn't actually receive the param — a silent-drop class of bug.

This subclass overrides :meth:`call_tool` to diff incoming ``arguments`` keys
against the tool's declared input schema (loaded from ``tools_manifest.json``)
BEFORE pydantic sees them. Unknown keys raise ``ToolError`` with a structured
message naming the offending key(s) and the valid set so an LLM can self-correct.
When a rejected key is another spelling of this tool's MAC parameter, the message
also names the parameter to use — guidance only; the key itself stays invalid.

Operates as composition (no FastMCP internals patched). Self-retires once
upstream lands ``extra="forbid"`` — the override becomes a no-op guard.

# bare "unknown argument" and no way to tell which one this tool wants. The
# canonical contract does not change: the call still fails, the message just says
# what to send instead.
#
# ``ap_mac`` is deliberately absent. It names a different thing — the access point
# to scan from, not the subject of the call — so telling a caller holding a client
# MAC to resend it as ``ap_mac`` would turn a rejected call into a wrong answer,
