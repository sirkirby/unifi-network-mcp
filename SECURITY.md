## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Primary Channel: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected versions
   - Potential impact

### Fallback: Email

If you are unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, email security concerns to the repository maintainer via the email listed on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sirkirby).

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 72 hours of report
- **Triage:** Within 7 days — we will confirm the vulnerability, assess severity, and communicate next steps
- **Fix:** Coordinated 90-day disclosure window from the date of report
- **Disclosure:** Security advisory published after fix is released, or after 90 days if no fix is available

### Credit

Reporters will be credited in the security advisory and CHANGELOG unless they request anonymity.

## Security Model

UniFi MCP is designed with a **secure-by-default** posture:

### Local-First Authentication

- Credentials (username/password) are used to authenticate directly with your local UniFi controller
- Credentials never leave your network — they are not sent to any external service
- Credentials are sent to the controller explicitly configured by the operator; the launcher and its configuration must be trusted
- Credentials can be kept out of the MCP client's environment with `UNIFI_<SERVER>_PASSWORD_FILE` or `UNIFI_<SERVER>_PASSWORD_COMMAND`; both indirections are honoured only for variables present in the environment the server was started with. The command provider's platform, executable-resolution and process-lifecycle contract is in [docs/credential-providers.md](docs/credential-providers.md)
- MCP servers never automatically load `.env` files or working-directory YAML. Custom YAML requires an explicit absolute `CONFIG_PATH` in the process environment. Load any trusted env file explicitly in the launcher; Docker Compose `env_file:` continues to work.
- API key authentication is supported as an experimental additive option
- The relay sidecar connects to a Cloudflare Worker via token-scoped WebSocket — no inbound ports are exposed

### MCP Transport Trust Boundary

- MCP HTTP does not authenticate callers. Anyone who can reach it can invoke the enabled tools using the server's controller credentials. Allowed Host/Origin checks protect against DNS rebinding; they do not authenticate a network peer.
- Package defaults disable HTTP and use a loopback bind address when enabled. Docker Compose explicitly enables HTTP inside its container network and publishes ports 3000–3002 on host `127.0.0.1` only.
- Remote MCP clients must use the authenticated Cloud Relay gateway or an authenticated TLS reverse proxy. Restrict direct backend access to that proxy; never publish the backend on a LAN/public interface. Trust every process/container with backend access.
- Use Docker Engine 28.0.0 or newer with ordinary NAT bridge networking. Older Docker engines can expose localhost-published ports to peers on the same network; direct-routing, host-network, and custom firewall configurations require separate access restrictions. See [Docker port publishing](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/port-publishing/).

### Permission System

- **Confirm-by-default** for all mutations (create, update, delete) — the client must explicitly request execution
- **Policy gates** (`UNIFI_POLICY_*` env vars) provide hard boundaries to disable specific actions when needed
- Read-only operations are always allowed
- All tools are always visible and discoverable in the tool index — authorization is enforced at call time
- Tools denied by policy gates return a clear error with guidance on how to enable

### Preview-Before-Confirm

- All state-changing operations use a two-step flow: preview first, then confirm
- Default call returns a preview of what would change
- Explicit `confirm=True` is required to execute the mutation
- The server does not verify human approval or require a previous preview. A client can supply `confirm=True` directly. Human approval must be enforced by the MCP client; `confirm` is an execution guard, not caller authentication or a prompt-injection defense.
- `UNIFI_TOOL_PERMISSION_MODE=bypass` can bypass this for automation workflows

### No Persistent Storage

- All state lives on the UniFi controller — the MCP server stores nothing locally
- No database, no cache, no session files
- Configuration is read from environment variables and config YAML at startup

## Known Controller Vulnerabilities

These are vulnerabilities in Ubiquiti's UniFi controller software, **not in this MCP server**. We document them here so users can verify their controllers are patched.

| CVE | CVSS | Affected Product | Affected Versions | Fixed In | Notes |
|-----|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| CVE-2026-22557 | 10.0 | UniFi Network | 10.0.x | See [Ubiquiti Advisory](https://community.ui.com/releases) | Critical — update immediately |

### Minimum Compatible Controller Versions

We recommend running at least these controller versions for security and API compatibility:

| Product | Minimum Version | Recommended |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| UniFi Network | 8.6+ | Latest stable |
| UniFi Protect | 5.0+ | Latest stable |
| UniFi Access | 2.0+ | Latest stable |
