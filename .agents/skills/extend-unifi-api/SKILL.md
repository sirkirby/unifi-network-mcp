  Apply this skill when working on apps/api/ — implementing resource endpoints,
  wiring multi-controller factory managers, designing pagination for new list
  endpoints, or choosing error contracts. Covers: Strawberry GraphQL type
  registration via type_registry.register_tool_type() for read tools; cursor-based
  pagination via the module-level paginate() function and Cursor class; render-hint
  kind conventions and forward-compatible optional extensions; HTTP 409 vs
  200-envelope error contracts for resource vs action endpoints; ManagerFactory
  class for multi-controller concurrency; apps/api dependency rule (unifi-core
  only); the 8-surface new-tool CI gate per Phase 8 (Strawberry projection,
  GraphQL Query field, REST resource route, Action dispatcher, Fixture e2e,
  Artifact regeneration, openapi.json drift gate, graphql-reference.md drift gate);
  and release tag policy. Activate even when the user hasn't explicitly asked about

# Extending the unifi-api REST Platform

\`apps/api/\` is the non-MCP HTTP delivery channel for UniFi controller data —
the substrate for future app consumers (Pi extension, dashboards, Electron
desktop). It is **not** an MCP server; its patterns, types, pagination, and
error contracts are distinct from the MCP layer and must stay that way.

As of Phase 6, the read-path serialization layer has been replaced with
Strawberry GraphQL types. Every new tool added to the API must implement a
full 8-surface contract per Phase 8 requirements (see Procedure A).

This skill covers everything needed when adding or modifying a resource in
\`apps/api/\`: registering Strawberry types, paginating list endpoints, setting
render hints, choosing error contracts, wiring factory managers for
multi-controller concurrency, and staying within the dependency rules.

## Prerequisites

- \`unifi-core\` already has the manager method for the resource (or you've
  added one following the existing manager patterns).
- The MCP tool function already exists (or is being added in the same PR).
- You are working in \`apps/api/src/unifi_api/\` — not in \`apps/network/\`,
  \`apps/protect/\`, or \`apps/access/\`.
- **Dependency rule:** \`apps/api/\` may only import from \`unifi-core\`. It must
  NOT import from \`unifi-mcp-shared\` (that package is for MCP servers only).
  Violating this creates circular imports.

## Procedure A: 8-Surface New-Tool Checklist (Phase 8 Requirement)

Phase 8 introduced a mandatory 8-surface requirement for every new tool added
to the API. All eight surfaces must be completed and gated before merge.

**The 8 surfaces:**

1. **Strawberry GraphQL type** — Define in \`apps/api/src/unifi_api/types/<domain>/<resource>.py\`
   Register via \`type_registry.register_tool_type("unifi_tool_name", YourType)\`

2. **GraphQL Query field** — Add query resolver in \`apps/api/src/unifi_api/resolvers/<domain>/<resource>.py\`
   Wire into \`schema.py\` Query root type

3. **REST resource route** — Implement \`GET /v1/sites/{site_id}/<resource>\` and \`GET /v1/sites/{site_id}/<resource>/{id}\`
   in \`apps/api/src/unifi_api/routes/<domain>/<resource>.py\`

4. **Action dispatcher** — Implement \`POST /v1/actions/unifi_tool_name\` with manager dispatch

5. **Fixture e2e test** — Add \`test_<tool_name>.py\` in \`apps/api/tests/fixtures/\` covering
   both GraphQL and REST resource paths with real controller data (or mocked)

6. **Artifact regeneration** — Run \`scripts/codegen_api_docs.py\` to update openapi.json

7. **openapi.json drift gate** — CI confirms openapi.json matches the current API surface
   (commit updated openapi.json from codegen)

8. **graphql-reference.md drift gate** — CI confirms graphql-reference.md matches the
   GraphQL schema (commit updated reference from codegen)

**Merge blocker:** Any PR adding a new tool/resource must declare all 8 surfaces
as complete. Missing surfaces are flagged in CI. Do NOT mark a surface complete
unless the code actually implements it.

## Procedure B: Registering Strawberry Types (Phase 6+)

**Serializers are obsolete.** Phase 6 replaced the serializer layer entirely with
Strawberry types. All read-path type marshaling now goes through GraphQL type
registration.

**1. Define the Strawberry type:**

Create a new file at the correct path:

\`\`\`
apps/api/src/unifi_api/types/<domain>/<resource>.py
\`\`\`

Example:

\`\`\`python
# apps/api/src/unifi_api/types/network/clients.py
import strawberry
from typing import Optional
from unifi_api.types._base import UniFiType

@strawberry.type
class Client(UniFiType):
    mac: str
    hostname: Optional[str]
    ip: Optional[str]
    status: str
    last_seen: int

    @classmethod
    def from_manager_object(cls, obj):
        """Convert manager object to Strawberry type."""
        return cls(
            mac=obj.raw.get("mac"),
            hostname=obj.raw.get("hostname"),
            ip=obj.raw.get("last_ip"),
            status=obj.raw.get("state"),
            last_seen=obj.raw.get("last_seen"),
        )
\`\`\`

**2. Register the type:**

Register it in \`apps/api/src/unifi_api/types/__init__.py\` (or a registry module):

\`\`\`python
from .network.clients import Client
from unifi_api.types._base import type_registry

type_registry.register_tool_type("unifi_list_clients", Client)
type_registry.register_tool_type("unifi_get_client", Client)
\`\`\`

**3. The registry automatically wires types for GraphQL Query fields and REST
resource endpoints.** Both paths dispatch through the same Strawberry type.

## Procedure C: Implementing Cursor-Based Pagination

Resource list endpoints use cursor-based pagination — not offset-based.
Offset pagination skips or duplicates rows under concurrent inserts; cursor
pagination is stable because it keys off the last-seen \`(ts, id)\` tuple.

**Endpoint signature:**

\`\`\`
GET /v1/sites/{id}/clients?limit=50&cursor=<opaque>
\`\`\`

**Response envelope** (every list endpoint returns this shape):

\`\`\`json
{
  "items": [ /* up to limit objects */ ],
  "next_cursor": "eyJsYXN0X2lkIjogImFiYzEyMyIsICJsYXN0X3RzIjogMTcyNzc0ODkwMH0="
}
\`\`\`

The cursor is an opaque base64-encoded \`{last_id, last_ts}\`. Consumers detect
end-of-list when \`next_cursor\` is \`null\`. Do NOT include \`total_count\` — it
requires a full table scan and is stale under concurrency.

**Using the pagination helpers** (\`services/pagination.py\`):

\`\`\`python
from unifi_api.services.pagination import Cursor, InvalidCursor, paginate

# Decode incoming cursor (if any)
cursor: Cursor | None = None
if cursor_param:
    try:
        cursor = Cursor.decode(cursor_param)
    except InvalidCursor:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail={"kind": "invalid_cursor", "message": "cursor position has been deleted"},
        )

# Fetch full snapshot from the manager (pagination is applied in-memory)
items = await client_manager.get_clients()

# Apply pagination: returns (page, next_cursor_or_None)
page, next_cursor = paginate(
    items,
    limit=limit,
    cursor=cursor,
    key_fn=lambda item: (item.raw.get("last_seen", 0), item.raw.get("_id", "")),
)

return {
    "items": [item_type.from_manager_object(item) for item in page],
    "next_cursor": next_cursor.encode() if next_cursor else None,
}
\`\`\`

\`paginate()\` is a **module-level function** — not a class method. It takes:
- \`items\`: the full unsorted snapshot from the manager
- \`limit\`: page size (keyword-only)
- \`cursor\`: decoded \`Cursor\` or \`None\` (keyword-only)
- \`key_fn\`: callable returning \`(ts, id)\` for each item (keyword-only)

It returns \`(page: list, next_cursor: Cursor | None)\`. The \`Cursor\` class
handles base64 encoding/decoding; call \`.encode()\` to produce the opaque
string for the response.

**Constraints:**

- \`limit\` default: 50; max: 200. Reject higher values with \`400 Bad Request\`.
- UniFi managers return full snapshots — pagination is applied in-memory after
  the manager call, not via per-page controller round-trips.

## Procedure D: Designing Render Hints

Every Strawberry type declares a \`kind\` field at the class level. This is the
minimum required contract. Optional metadata fields are additive — declare them
only when a specific consumer needs them.

**Seed kinds:**

| Kind  | When to use                                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| \`LIST\`        | Flat collection (clients, devices, rules)             |
| \`DETAIL\`      | Single entity with full fields                        |
| \`DIFF\`        | Structured change delta (mutation preview)            |
| \`TIMESERIES\`  | Time-indexed data (uptime, event graphs)              |
| \`EVENT_LOG\`   | Log entries with timestamps                           |
| \`EMPTY\`       | Success with no output (config write, delete)         |
| \`STREAM\`      | Streaming data (camera streams, live feeds)           |

**Minimum — every type must have this:**

\`\`\`python
@strawberry.type
class MyType(UniFiType):
    kind: str = "LIST"  # required
    # ... fields ...
\`\`\`

**Optional extensions — declare only what downstream renderers need:**

\`\`\`python
@strawberry.type
class MyType(UniFiType):
    kind: str = "LIST"
    primary_key: str = "mac"                              # optional
    display_columns: list[str] = ["hostname", "ip"]      # optional
    sort_default: str = "last_seen"                       # optional
\`\`\`

Clients that don't understand optional fields ignore them — no breaking change.

## Procedure E: Resource Endpoints vs. Action Endpoints — Error Contracts

These two endpoint families follow different error conventions. Don't mix them.

**Resource endpoints** (\`GET /v1/sites/{id}/{resource}\`) follow REST convention:
HTTP status code signals success; body provides detail.

| Situation                        | Status | Body                                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Success                          | 200    | \`{"items": [...], "next_cursor": ...}\`                        |
| Controller lacks required product| **409**| \`{"kind": "capability_mismatch", "missing_product": "protect", "message": "..."}\` |
| Invalid cursor                   | 400    | \`{"kind": "invalid_cursor", "message": "..."}\`                |
| limit > 200                      | 400    | standard validation error                                     |

Why 409 for capability mismatch (not 404, not 200):
- Not 404: the endpoint path is valid; the issue is controller state.
- Not 200: a GET that can't return the resource is a 4xx, not a success.
- 409 "conflicts with server state" is accurate: the controller doesn't have
  the required product.

\`\`\`
GET /v1/sites/default/cameras?controller=xyz
→ HTTP 409 Conflict
{"kind": "capability_mismatch", "missing_product": "protect",
 "message": "Controller does not support the Protect product"}
\`\`\`

**Action endpoints** (\`POST /v1/actions/{tool_name}\`) follow MCP convention:
always return HTTP 200; surface errors in the envelope.

\`\`\`json
POST /v1/actions/unifi_list_cameras
→ HTTP 200
{"success": false, "error": "Cameras product not available"}
\`\`\`

**Client handling pattern:** switch on \`status === 409\` before parsing body;
use \`kind === "capability_mismatch"\` to distinguish from ETag conflicts on
mutations.

## Procedure F: Wiring the Multi-Controller Factory

\`unifi-api\` serves multiple concurrent controller sessions in one process, so
the MCP-style global singleton factories don't work here. The implementation
uses \`ManagerFactory\` — a manual async-aware cache (explicitly **not**
\`@lru_cache\`, because async values and per-call session args make \`@lru_cache\`
the wrong tool).

**All factory logic lives in one module:**

\`\`\`
apps/api/src/unifi_api/services/managers.py
\`\`\`

**Accessing managers in routes** — the factory is wired into \`app.state\`
during lifespan; routes access it there:

\`\`\`python
from unifi_api.services.managers import ManagerFactory

# In a route handler:
factory: ManagerFactory = request.app.state.manager_factory

# Get a connection manager for a specific controller + product:
cm = await factory.get_connection_manager(session, controller_id, "network")

# Get a named domain manager (attr_name matches the manager class name in the
# product builder dict, e.g. "client_manager", "firewall_manager"):
client_mgr = await factory.get_domain_manager(
    session, controller_id, "network", "client_manager"
)
\`\`\`

\`ManagerFactory\` uses \`asyncio.Lock\` per \`controller_id\` around construction
to prevent concurrent-cache-miss races. Cache lives at the connection layer
because that's where aiohttp session state lives; manager construction is
cheap (just stores a reference to the \`ConnectionManager\`).

**Cache invalidation** — on controller delete or credentials update:

\`\`\`python
await factory.invalidate_controller(controller_id)
\`\`\`

This evicts all cached \`ConnectionManager\` and domain manager instances for
that controller.

**\`unifi-core\` needs zero changes** for this pattern. Existing managers
already support per-controller instantiation; \`ManagerFactory\` layers the
async-safe caching on top.

## Cross-Cutting Gotchas

**Dependency rule — never import \`unifi-mcp-shared\` from \`apps/api/\`.** \`unifi-mcp-shared\` contains validator schemas for MCP servers. Importing it from \`apps/api/\` creates circular imports and couples two unrelated delivery channels. The correct dependency chain is: \`apps/api/\` → \`unifi-core\` only.

**Serializer layer is obsolete (Phase 6+).** Do not write new serializers. All read-path marshaling goes through Strawberry types and \`from_manager_object()\` conversion. Legacy serializer code may remain for reference but is not wired into new tools.

**8-surface requirement is mandatory as of Phase 8.** Every new tool must implement all 8 surfaces (type, query, resource routes, action dispatcher, fixtures, codegen artifacts, drift gates). Incomplete PRs are merge-blocked by CI.

**Release tag policy — no \`api/*\` tags until Phase 7.** Phases 0–6 are internal development only. The first consumer-facing tag is \`api/v0.1.0\` (Phase 7), paired with a GHCR Docker image, docs, and release notes. Do not cut partial release tags; they create support burden before the full surface is ready.

**Single PR per phase.** Phases 0–2 each landed as a single PR despite comparable scope. Phase 3 follows the same pattern. Splitting into sub-PRs creates incoherent transitional states with no shipping value to justify the overhead.

**New tool category contribution checklist** (extends \`add-tool-category\`):
1. Manager method in \`unifi-core\` — shared, already required
2. MCP tool function in \`apps/<domain>/\` — already required
3. **All 8 surfaces** in \`apps/api/\` — Strawberry type, GraphQL query, REST routes, action dispatcher, fixture tests, codegen artifacts, and drift gate commits — required for Phase 8+ CI gate
