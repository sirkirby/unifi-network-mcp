# Live Smoke Testing Against Real UniFi Hardware

`scripts/live_smoke.py` is the manifest-driven live hardware test harness. It validates API
contracts that mock-based CI (unit tests, golden fixtures) structurally cannot catch — auth
token expiry, payload normalization, API version mismatches, and hardware-specific field
assumptions. Phase 2 live smoke runs caught 3 critical bugs before merge. Run live smoke
before every major merge that touches API-facing code.

## Prerequisites

Before any live run, ensure:

1. **`.env` file at project root** (gitignored) with real credentials:
   ```
   UNIFI_HOST=<controller-hostname-or-ip>
   UNIFI_USERNAME=<admin-username>
   UNIFI_PASSWORD=<admin-password>
   UNIFI_SITE=<site-id>           # usually "default"
   # For Access domain:
   UNIFI_ACCESS_API_KEY=<access-api-key>
   ```

2. **Per-server `tools_manifest.json` is up-to-date** — the harness auto-discovers tools
   from each server's manifest at:
   - `apps/network/src/unifi_network_mcp/tools_manifest.json`
   - `apps/protect/src/unifi_protect_mcp/tools_manifest.json`
   - `apps/access/src/unifi_access_mcp/tools_manifest.json`

   New tools registered there are automatically included in smoke runs; no manual harness
   edits are needed just to add read-only or preview coverage for a newly registered tool.

3. **Target hardware is reachable** — verify connectivity before running:
   ```bash
   curl -k https://$UNIFI_HOST
   ```

4. **Branch context** — the harness lives in `codex/live-smoke-harness`. Confirm you're on
   the correct branch before running extended phases.

## Procedure A: Understand Tool Classification Tiers

The harness classifies tools dynamically from manifest annotations and the `RISKY_OPERATION_NAMES`
set (line ~90 in `scripts/live_smoke.py`). `safety_tier()` on `LiveSmokeRunner` drives
phase inclusion.

| Tier (`safety_tier` value) | How it's determined | Run gate |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-|
| `read_only` | `readOnlyHint: true` annotation in manifest | Included in `readonly` and `safe` phases |
| `preview_or_safe_lifecycle` | Has `confirm` param; not in `RISKY_OPERATION_NAMES` | Preview (confirm=False) in `preview`/`safe`; lifecycle pairs in `lifecycle`/`safe` |
| `requires_approval` | In `RISKY_OPERATION_NAMES` set OR `destructiveHint: true` | Excluded from automated runs; listed in `pending_approval`; manual only |
| `defer_heavy_read` | In `STREAM_OR_HEAVY_READS` set (streaming/export tools) | Skipped unless `--include-heavy-reads` passed |
| `mutating_requires_review` | Has writes but no `confirm` param and not explicitly risky | Flagged for manual review |

**Classification is driven by manifest annotations — not static tier lists.** When in doubt,
set `destructiveHint: true` on the tool's `ToolAnnotations`. A tool missing `readOnlyHint`
that does only reads is silently treated as mutating; fix the annotation.

## Procedure B: Run the Harness with `--phase` Control

The `--phase` flag bounds blast radius. The `--server` flag is required for all MCP-direct
phases. Always start at the safest phase and advance only after the prior phase passes cleanly.

```bash
# Safest run — readonly + preview + safe lifecycles (default phase is "safe")
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase safe

# Read-only tools only (narrowest scope)
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase readonly

# Preview phase — all mutating tools called with confirm=False
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server protect --phase preview

# Approved operations — runs all safe lifecycles plus explicitly approved mutations
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase approved

# Run all servers at once (requires full .env with Access and Protect creds)
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server all --phase safe

# Inventory — prints safety_tier classification for every tool; no live calls
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase inventory
```

**Phase progression guidance:**
- Start every new tool or hardware target with `--phase readonly`.
- Advance to `--phase safe` only after `readonly` passes cleanly.
- Advance to `--phase approved` only after `safe` passes cleanly.
- Never skip directly to `approved` on a first run against a new tool or new hardware.
- Use `--phase inventory` to audit tier assignments without making any live calls.
- Phase scope has expanded over the project lifecycle: Phase 1 was intentionally narrow
  (deployment/auth only, no controller-touching); Phase 2 added full Protect physical actions
  and Access lock/unlock patterns. Expect further expansion for each new REST endpoint domain.

**Expected output:** The harness streams per-tool status to stdout. A passing run exits with
a summary count. Any `failed` or `exception` status line requires investigation before merge.

## Procedure C: Human-in-the-Loop Mutation Gate

Mutation tools require a two-stage human gate. The `preview` phase (included in `safe`)
handles Stage 1 automatically; Stage 2 requires human review before running `--phase approved`.

**Stage 1 — Preview phase (harness does this automatically during `safe`/`preview`):**

The harness calls all `preview_or_safe_lifecycle` tools with `confirm=False`. This returns
a preview payload without executing any write. Review the output in the terminal and in the
per-server artifact file in `live-smoke-results/`.

**Stage 2 — Human approval, then approved phase:**

```bash
# After reviewing Stage 1 preview output, if all looks correct:
python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase approved
```

The `approved` phase runs explicitly coded lifecycle methods (e.g.,
`lifecycle_network_dns()`, `lifecycle_network_oon_policy()`) that execute idempotent
create+delete pairs with `confirm=True`.

**Rules:**
- Never skip Stage 1 — even for tools you've run before, always review the preview against
  current hardware state. A lifecycle run against stale assumptions can leave orphaned
  resources on the controller.
- If the preview shows unexpected scope, wrong site, or wrong resource count, stop.
  Investigate the tool's argument construction before proceeding to `approved`.
- Safe-lifecycle runs should leave zero net hardware changes. After an `approved` run,
  verify the controller UI shows no orphaned test resources.

## Procedure D: Interpret Artifacts in `live-smoke-results/`

Each run writes one JSON file per server, stamped with a timestamp:
```
live-smoke-results/{server}-{timestamp}.json
```

The file contains a `SmokeReport` serialized as JSON:
```json
{
  "server": "network",
  "started_at": "2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "finished_at": "2026-05-01T12:03:45+00:00",
  "connected": true,
  "records": [
    {
      "tool": "unifi_list_clients",
      "phase": "readonly",
      "status": "ok",
      "args": {},
      "duration_ms": 342,
      "success": true,
      "error": null,
      "summary": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "created_resources": [],
  "cleaned_resources": [],
  "pending_approval": []
}
```

**Status values per record:**
- `"ok"` — tool completed; `success` is `true`; inspect `summary` for shape correctness.
- `"failed"` — tool returned `success: false`; check `error` field.
- `"skipped"` — tool excluded from current phase or args unavailable; not a failure.
- `"exception"` — Python exception raised during invocation; check `error` for traceback.

**API contract mismatches show up in `summary` content, not always as `"failed"`.** For
example, an Access proxy returning HTTP 200 with an auth-failure body: `status` is `"ok"`
but `success` is `false` or `summary` contains no usable data. Always inspect `summary`
content and `pending_approval`, not just the overall status counts.

**Confirmed API contract failure patterns** (discovered through live testing; mocks did not
catch any of these):

| Pattern | Symptom in artifact | Root cause |
|---------|-------------------|-|
| Access proxy auth masking | `status: ok`, empty/error summary | Token expiry → proxy returns 404 wrapped in 200 |
| OON payload normalization | Create succeeds, object malformed | Manager-side shape translation required; API expects different field structure |
| Alarm archive preview semantics | Preview count ≠ actual archived count | Mismatch between filter used in preview vs. execution |
| `hardware_platform` field assumption | Field missing or wrong type on some models | Not all hardware versions expose this field |
| Network alerts/IPS API version incompatibility | 404 or schema error on known endpoint | Endpoint path changed between controller firmware versions |
| Access `CODE_UNAUTHORIZED` ambiguity | Same error code for expired token vs. wrong credentials | Cannot distinguish root cause without inspecting response body detail |

When you see a live smoke failure with no corresponding unit test failure, assume API
contract mismatch first. Inspect the full `summary` body before looking at tool logic.

## Procedure E: Extend the Harness for New Tools

When a new tool is scaffolded and registered in the server's `tools_manifest.json`, extend
the harness as follows:

1. **Run inventory to see current classification:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase inventory | grep unifi_new_thing
   ```
   Confirm `safety_tier` matches your intent. Classification is driven automatically by
   manifest annotations — check the tool's `ToolAnnotations` in the tool module.

2. **If the tool should be `read_only`:** Ensure `readOnlyHint=True` is set on
   `ToolAnnotations` in the tool function. The harness will auto-include it in `readonly`
   phase. No harness edits needed.

3. **If the tool has a `confirm` param (preview/lifecycle):** The harness auto-includes it
   in `preview` phase with `confirm=False`. For safe lifecycle testing (create+delete pair),
   add a new lifecycle method to the `LiveSmokeRunner` class in `scripts/live_smoke.py` and
   call it from `run_lifecycles()` or `run_approved()`:
   ```python
   async def lifecycle_network_new_thing(self) -> None:
       # 1. Create the resource
       create_rec = await self.call("unifi_create_new_thing", {...}, "lifecycle")
       if not create_rec.success:
           return
       resource_id = ...  # extract from create_rec.summary
       # 2. Delete it (idempotent cleanup)
       await self.call("unifi_delete_new_thing", {"id": resource_id, "confirm": True}, "lifecycle")
   ```

4. **If the tool is risky/destructive:** Add it to `RISKY_OPERATION_NAMES` (the set at
   line ~90 in `scripts/live_smoke.py`) or set `destructiveHint=True` on `ToolAnnotations`.
   This moves it to `pending_approval` and excludes it from automated phases.

5. **Run read-only phase first, inspect the artifact:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/live_smoke.py --server network --phase readonly
   cat live-smoke-results/network-*.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A5 unifi_new_thing
   ```
   Confirm `status: "ok"` and `success: true` and that `summary` has the expected shape.

6. **Advance to safe/approved phase** after readonly passes cleanly.

7. **Document the tier classification in the PR description** — reviewers need to know the
   blast-radius classification to sign off on the smoke evidence.

## Cross-Cutting Gotchas

- **Mock + golden fixtures are insufficient by design.** Live smoke is the only mechanism
  that catches auth token expiry, real payload shapes, hardware-specific fields, and API
  version skew. Treat live smoke as a required quality gate, not optional extra validation.

- **`.env` is gitignored — never commit credentials.** If you see `UNIFI_HOST` or
  `UNIFI_PASSWORD` in a diff, abort the commit immediately and rotate the credentials.

- **`--server` is required for all MCP-direct phases.** Omitting it causes a parse error.
  `api-actions`, `api-resources`, and `api-streams` phases use a different runner and do
  not require `--server`.

- **56 passing approved-ops is the Phase 2 baseline.** The `codex/live-smoke-harness`
  branch established this count. A PR that drops the count or introduces new failures
  requires a documented explanation and fix before merge.

- **Credential rotation invalidates prior artifacts.** If credentials changed between runs,
  artifacts from prior runs cannot be used as PR evidence. Re-run from scratch.

- **Phase scope expands with each new domain.** Phase 1 deliberately excluded
  controller-touching endpoints; Phase 2 added them. Phase 3 will require harness expansion
  for new REST endpoints. Every new tool category must be classified and added — do not
  assume prior phases cover new domains.

- **`tools_manifest.json` is the source of truth for auto-discovery.** Manifest annotation
  correctness (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`) and harness registration (for lifecycle
  methods) are both required. Wrong annotations silently misclassify tools.
