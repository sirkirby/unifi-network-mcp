  Apply when extending unifi-mcp-shared with new entrypoints, deciding whether
  new capability belongs in unifi-core vs. unifi-mcp-shared, syncing relay
  protocol changes, or bumping workspace dependency versions across the monorepo.
  Covers four recurring procedures: (1) DI-only rule for shared-package entrypoints
  to avoid circular-import blast radius across all three app servers; (2) the
  "connectivity primitive or MCP layer?" scope gate for placing new capability in
  the right package; (3) manual relay protocol sync to discovery.py and protocol.py
  when shared-package protocol changes, because those files do not import from the
  shared package and won't pick up changes automatically; (4) lockstep pyproject.toml
  version bumping across unifi-mcp-shared and all four dependent apps when unifi-core
  is versioned. Activate this skill even if the user doesn't explicitly ask about
  isolation boundaries — any shared-package surgery or monorepo dependency bump
  triggers it.

# Shared Package Extension and Isolation Boundaries

The monorepo has three structural packages with hard isolation rules: `unifi-core`
(connectivity primitives), `unifi-mcp-shared` (MCP layer — permissions, confirmation
flow, lazy loading, config), and `unifi-mcp-relay` (relay sidecar). Every time
`unifi-mcp-shared` gains a new entrypoint, every time `unifi-core` is versioned, or
every time the relay protocol changes, a specific procedure applies. Skipping them
causes import-time startup failures or silent protocol drift.

## Prerequisites

- Working in the monorepo at the repo root
- `uv` is the package manager; Python 3.13+ is enforced by workspace constraints
- Know which scenario applies: new shared entrypoint, scope decision, relay sync,
  or workspace version bump — each has its own procedure below

## Procedure A: Adding a New Entrypoint to `unifi-mcp-shared` (DI-Only Rule)

Every new entrypoint in `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/` must accept app-specific hooks
as parameters — never import directly from `unifi_network_mcp`, `unifi_protect_mcp`,
or `unifi_access_mcp` inside the shared package.

**Why this matters:** The shared package is already depended on by all three app
servers. A direct import back into any app server creates a cycle that breaks all
three servers at import time. The blast radius is total — no app server starts, and
the `ImportError` stack trace points at the shared package, making the root cause
non-obvious. This is the #1 documented contributor mistake in this codebase.

**Canonical pattern (correct):**

```python
# packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/meta_tools.py
def register_meta_tools(
    mcp,
    get_tools_fn,        # injected by the calling app server
    get_server_info_fn,  # injected by the calling app server
):
    """Register meta tools. App-specific behavior provided via DI parameters."""
    ...
```

```python
# packages/unifi-mcp-shared/src/unifi_mcp_shared/permissioned_tool.py
def setup_permissioned_tool(
    mcp,
    tool_fn,
    permission_checker,  # injected hook — never imported from the app
):
    ...
```

**Anti-pattern (wrong):**

```python
# packages/unifi-mcp-shared/some_module.py
from unifi_network_mcp.config import get_config  # ← circular; breaks all three servers
```

**Steps:**

1. Write the new entrypoint with all app-specific behavior expressed as callable
   parameters or `typing.Protocol` types defined in the shared package.
2. Verify no app imports slipped in:
   ```bash
   grep -r "from unifi_network_mcp\|from unifi_protect_mcp\|from unifi_access_mcp" \
       packages/unifi-mcp-shared/
   ```
   Any hit is a bug — replace with an injected parameter.
3. Wire the injection at each app-server call site.
4. Confirm no circular import across all three servers:
   ```bash
   python -c "import unifi_network_mcp"
   python -c "import unifi_protect_mcp"
   python -c "import unifi_access_mcp"
   ```

**Tip:** For complex injected hooks, prefer a `typing.Protocol` over a bare
`Callable`. It lets mypy catch mismatches at the call site in each app server
rather than failing at runtime.

## Procedure B: Scope Gate — `unifi-core` vs. `unifi-mcp-shared`

Before adding new capability to either package, apply this decision test:

> **"Is this a connectivity primitive or an MCP layer concern?"**

| Belongs in `unifi-core` | Belongs in `unifi-mcp-shared` |
|---|---|
| Auth / session management | Permission checking |
| HTTP retry logic | Confirmation flow |
| Response merge / pagination | Lazy tool loading |
| Exception types | MCP config management |
| Connection pooling | Tool registration helpers |
| UniFi API request primitives | Meta-tools |

**Decision tree:**

1. Does the code talk directly to UniFi hardware or manage HTTP sessions? → `unifi-core`
2. Does the code coordinate MCP protocol concerns (permissions, tool registration,
   confirmations, config loading)? → `unifi-mcp-shared`
3. Does the code reference MCP types (`mcp`, `FastMCP`, tool decorators)? → `unifi-mcp-shared`
4. Still unclear? Ask: "Would this be useful in a non-MCP CLI that calls the UniFi API?"
   - Yes → `unifi-core`
   - No → `unifi-mcp-shared`

**After placing, verify the import direction is preserved:**

```
unifi_network_mcp  →  unifi-mcp-shared  →  unifi-core
unifi_protect_mcp  →  unifi-mcp-shared  →  unifi-core
unifi_access_mcp   →  unifi-mcp-shared  →  unifi-core
```

Arrows flow left-to-right only. No package imports from anything to its right in
this chain. Check with:

```bash
grep -r "from unifi_mcp_shared\|import unifi_mcp_shared" packages/unifi-core/
grep -r "from unifi_network_mcp\|from unifi_protect_mcp\|from unifi_access_mcp" \
    packages/unifi-mcp-shared/ packages/unifi-core/
```

Both commands should return nothing.

## Procedure C: Relay Protocol Sync

`packages/unifi-mcp-relay/` depends on `unifi-mcp-shared` (declared in its
`pyproject.toml`) and uses `unifi-core` transitively. However, the two files that
implement relay-specific protocol logic do **not** import from the shared package:

- `packages/unifi-mcp-relay/src/unifi_mcp_relay/discovery.py` — MCP protocol
  discovery (initialize handshake, tools/list, lazy-tool index)
- `packages/unifi-mcp-relay/src/unifi_mcp_relay/protocol.py` — relay wire format
  (WebSocket message types, `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `RegisterMessage`)

**Consequence:** When the shared-package protocol changes (new message format, new
handshake field, changed endpoint path), those changes are **not automatically
reflected in these relay files**. There is no import error, no failing test, and no
CI check that catches relay protocol drift — it fails silently at runtime when a
client using the new protocol connects through a relay running the old one.

**Steps:**

1. Identify exactly what changed in `unifi-mcp-shared` (message schema field,
   endpoint path, header name, error envelope shape).
2. Open both relay files and locate the parallel implementation of the changed behavior.
3. Port the change manually — `discovery.py` and `protocol.py` share no abstractions
   with the shared package.
4. Trace the message path end-to-end through both implementations to confirm they agree.
5. If a meaningful test exists for the relay, run it; otherwise document the manual
   verification you performed in the PR.

**PR checklist trigger:** Any PR modifying the shared-package protocol must include a
"relay sync" section confirming `discovery.py` and `protocol.py` were reviewed and
updated if necessary. Community PR reviewers: look for this section.

## Procedure D: Workspace Dependency Version Bumping

When `unifi-core` is released at a new version, all dependents must be updated in
lockstep. `uv` workspace constraints enforce Python 3.13+ and will reject inconsistent
version pins.

**Dependent `pyproject.toml` files to update (five total):**

- `packages/unifi-mcp-shared/pyproject.toml`
- `apps/network/pyproject.toml`
- `apps/protect/pyproject.toml`
- `apps/access/pyproject.toml`
- `apps/api/pyproject.toml`

**Steps:**

1. Confirm the new `unifi-core` version (e.g., `0.4.0`).
2. Update the `unifi-core` entry in each of the five files:
   ```toml
   unifi-core = ">=0.4.0"
   ```
3. From the repo root, run `uv sync` to validate workspace constraints resolve cleanly.
   A failure here usually means a file was missed.
4. Commit all six files together (the `unifi-core` bump commit plus all five dependents)
   in a single commit. Never split — an intermediate state where some dependents still
   reference the old version breaks CI for any checkout between the two commits.
5. Tag `unifi-core` before tagging any dependent package. Dependency order and no-batching
   rules apply (see tag-push ordering gotcha in project memory).

## Cross-Cutting Gotchas

**Blast radius is total, not partial.** A circular import caused by one forbidden
`from unifi_network_mcp` inside `unifi-mcp-shared` breaks all three app servers, not
just the one referenced. The `ImportError` names the shared package in the traceback,
which misleads debugging toward the symptom rather than the cause.

**Relay drift has no automated safeguard.** Silent drift is the failure mode — both
sides appear healthy until a real client exercises the changed protocol path. Manual
review on every protocol-touching PR is the only protection.

**All five pyproject.toml files, every time.** Forgetting even one creates a workspace
inconsistency that `uv` may not surface immediately but will fail in CI or on a fresh
`uv sync`. Use `grep -r "unifi-core" apps/ packages/unifi-mcp-shared/` to audit
before committing.

**DI parameters document the contract.** When a new shared entrypoint accepts injected
callables, name the parameters descriptively (`get_tools_fn`, `permission_checker`) and
add a docstring. Future contributors reading the shared package won't have the app-server
context that makes the parameter's purpose obvious.
