# UniFi Network MCP Server

You have access to a UniFi Network MCP server that lets you query and manage a UniFi Network Controller. It provides 91 tools covering devices, clients, firewall, VPN, routing, WLANs, statistics, and more.

## Tool Discovery

The server uses **lazy loading** by default — only meta-tools are registered initially. Use them to find and call any tool:

| Meta-Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `unifi_tool_index` | List all 91 tools with full parameter schemas |
| `unifi_execute` | Call any tool by name (essential in lazy mode) |
| `unifi_batch` | Run multiple tools in parallel |
| `unifi_batch_status` | Check async batch job status |

**Workflow:** Call `unifi_tool_index` to find the right tool, then `unifi_execute` to call it. For multiple independent queries, use `unifi_batch` — it's significantly faster than sequential calls.

## Safety Model

The server is "secure by default" because it controls real network infrastructure.

**Read operations** — always available. All `list_*`, `get_*`, and query tools work without special permissions.

**Mutations** — permission-gated with mixed defaults:
- **Enabled by default:** firewall policies, port forwards, traffic routes, QoS rules, VPN clients, ACL rules, vouchers, user groups
- **Disabled by default (high-risk):** networks, WLANs, devices, clients, routes, VPN servers
- **Delete operations** — always disabled by default

If a mutation fails with a permission error, tell the user the env var to set: `UNIFI_PERMISSIONS_<CATEGORY>_<ACTION>=true`

**Confirmation flow** — every mutation uses preview-then-confirm:
1. Default call → returns preview of what would change
2. Call with `confirm=true` → executes the mutation

Always preview first and show the user before confirming.

## Response Format

All tools return: `{"success": true, "data": ...}`, `{"success": false, "error": "..."}`, or `{"success": true, "requires_confirmation": true, "preview": ...}`. Always check `success` first.

## Efficiency Tips

- **Batch reads** — `unifi_batch` for parallel queries (biggest efficiency win)
- **`unifi_lookup_by_ip`** — faster than listing all clients when you know the IP
- **Use filters** — most list tools accept time range, type, and ID parameters
- **`unifi_get_top_clients`** — fastest way to find bandwidth hogs
- **Check health first** — `unifi_get_network_health` for quick "is everything OK?"

## Authentication

Username and password are **required** (local admin credentials, not Ubiquiti SSO). API key support exists but is **experimental** — limited to read-only operations and a subset of tools.

To configure, run `/unifi-network:setup` or set env vars manually:
```
UNIFI_NETWORK_HOST=192.168.1.1
UNIFI_NETWORK_USERNAME=admin
UNIFI_NETWORK_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Other UniFi Servers

If the user also has cameras or door access control, other UniFi MCP plugins are available:
- `unifi-protect` — security cameras, NVR, recordings, smart detections
- `unifi-access` — door locks, credentials, visitors, access policies

Cameras and access readers appear as network clients — use `unifi_lookup_by_ip` to cross-reference if troubleshooting connectivity for those devices.
