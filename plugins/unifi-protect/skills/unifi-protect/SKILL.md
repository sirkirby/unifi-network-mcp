# UniFi Protect MCP Server

You have access to a UniFi Protect MCP server that lets you query and manage a UniFi Protect NVR. It provides 34 tools covering cameras, smart detections, recordings, snapshots, lights, sensors, and chimes.

## Tool Discovery

The server uses **lazy loading** by default — only meta-tools are registered initially:

| Meta-Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `protect_tool_index` | List all 34 tools with full parameter schemas |
| `protect_execute` | Call any tool by name (essential in lazy mode) |
| `protect_batch` | Run multiple tools in parallel |
| `protect_batch_status` | Check async batch job status |

**Workflow:** Call `protect_tool_index` to find the right tool, then `protect_execute` to call it. Use `protect_batch` for multiple independent queries.

## Safety Model

**All mutations are disabled by default** because Protect controls physical security hardware.

**Read operations** — always available. Listing cameras, events, snapshots, sensor readings — all work without permissions.

**Mutations** require explicit opt-in via env vars:
- `UNIFI_PERMISSIONS_CAMERAS_UPDATE=true` — camera settings, recording toggle, PTZ, reboot
- `UNIFI_PERMISSIONS_LIGHTS_UPDATE=true` — light brightness, PIR sensitivity
- `UNIFI_PERMISSIONS_CHIMES_UPDATE=true` — chime volume, trigger

**Confirmation flow** — every mutation uses preview-then-confirm:
1. Default call → returns preview of what would change
2. Call with `confirm=true` → executes the mutation

Always preview first and show the user before confirming.

## Response Format

All tools return: `{"success": true, "data": ...}`, `{"success": false, "error": "..."}`, or `{"success": true, "requires_confirmation": true, "preview": ...}`. Always check `success` first.

## Key Capabilities

- **Snapshots:** `protect_get_snapshot` with `include_image=true` returns base64 JPEG inline
- **RTSP streams:** `protect_get_camera_streams` gives stream URLs for video player integration
- **Smart detections:** `protect_list_smart_detections` filters by type (person, vehicle, animal, package, face, licensePlate). These are the highest-signal events — prioritize over raw motion.
- **Event camera names:** All event responses include `camera_name` alongside `camera_id` — no need to call `protect_list_cameras` separately to resolve names.
- **Real-time events:** `protect_recent_events` reads from websocket buffer instantly (no API call). Buffer holds ~100 events with 5-minute TTL. Use `protect_list_events` for historical queries.
- **Video export:** `protect_export_clip` returns metadata (not video data — too large for MCP). Max 2 hours, supports timelapse (fps: 4=60x, 8=120x, 20=300x)
- **PTZ:** Only zoom works via API. For pan/tilt, use `protect_ptz_preset` with saved positions

## Efficiency Tips

- **Use `protect_batch` for parallel queries** — biggest performance win. Batch smart detections + events in one call.
- **Prefer `protect_list_smart_detections` over `protect_list_events`** for security analysis — smart detections are pre-classified (person, vehicle, etc.) and higher signal than raw motion.
- **`protect_recent_events` is fast but small** — only a few minutes of buffered data. For anything beyond real-time monitoring, use `protect_list_events` with time range filters.
- **Limit results** — event queries default to 30 but can return large payloads. Use `limit` parameter to keep responses focused.
- **Security digest** — for comprehensive event summaries, use the `security-digest` skill which handles batch calls, severity classification, and cross-product correlation.

## Authentication

Username and password are **required** (local admin credentials, not Ubiquiti SSO). API key support exists but is **experimental** — limited to read-only operations and a subset of tools.

To configure, run `/unifi-protect:setup` or set env vars manually:
```
UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST=192.168.1.1
UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME=admin
UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Other UniFi Servers

If the user also has networking or door access control, other UniFi MCP plugins are available:
- `unifi-network` — network devices, clients, firewall, VPN, routing
- `unifi-access` — door locks, credentials, visitors, access policies

Cameras are network clients — if a camera appears offline, the Network server can help check connectivity via `unifi_lookup_by_ip`.
