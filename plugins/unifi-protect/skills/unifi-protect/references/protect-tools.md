## Meta-Tools

Always available, regardless of registration mode.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `protect_tool_index` | List all available tools with full parameter schemas |
| `protect_execute` | Execute any tool by name (essential in lazy mode) |
| `protect_batch` | Run multiple tools in parallel |
| `protect_batch_status` | Check status of an async batch job |

---

## Cameras

<!-- AUTO:tools:cameras -->
10 tools.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `protect_get_camera` | Read | Returns detailed information for a single camera including firmware, IP address, MAC, mic/speaker settings, IR/HDR mode, stream channels,... |
| `protect_get_camera_analytics` | Read | Returns motion and smart detection analytics for a camera including current detection state, last-detected timestamps for each type (pers... |
| `protect_get_camera_streams` | Read | Returns RTSP/RTSPS stream URLs for a camera organized by channel (High, Medium, Low). |
| `protect_get_snapshot` | Read | Fetches a JPEG snapshot from a camera. |
| `protect_list_cameras` | Read | Lists all cameras adopted by the Protect NVR with their name, model, connection state, recording mode, and whether they are currently rec... |
| `protect_ptz_move` | Read | Adjusts PTZ camera position. |
| `protect_ptz_preset` | Read | Moves a PTZ camera to a saved preset position by slot number. |
| `protect_reboot_camera` | Mutate | Reboots a camera. |
| `protect_toggle_recording` | Mutate | Enables or disables recording on a camera. |
| `protect_update_camera_settings` | Mutate | Updates camera settings such as IR LED mode, HDR mode, mic/speaker volume, status light, and motion detection. |
<!-- /AUTO:tools:cameras -->

**Tips:**
- `protect_get_snapshot` with `include_image=true` returns base64 JPEG inline — useful for quick visual checks
- `protect_get_camera_streams` gives RTSP URLs for video player integration — these can be shared with the user
- Camera settings use a dict: `settings={"ir_led_mode": "auto", "hdr_mode": true, "mic_enabled": true}`
- PTZ: only zoom works via the API. For pan/tilt, use preset positions

**Permission env vars:**
- `UNIFI_PERMISSIONS_CAMERAS_UPDATE=true` — enables settings, recording toggle, PTZ, reboot

## Events

<!-- AUTO:tools:events -->
7 tools.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `protect_get_event` | Read | Get detailed information for a single event by ID. |
| `protect_get_event_thumbnail` | Read | Get the thumbnail image for an event. |
| `protect_list_events` | Read | Query events from the NVR with optional filters. |
| `protect_list_smart_detections` | Read | List smart detection events (person, vehicle, animal, package, etc.) with optional filters. |
| `protect_recent_events` | Read | Get recent events from the in-memory websocket buffer. |
| `protect_subscribe_events` | Read | Returns instructions for subscribing to real-time Protect events. |
| `protect_acknowledge_event` | Mutate | Acknowledge an event by marking it as a favorite on the NVR. |
<!-- /AUTO:tools:events -->

**Tips:**
- **Real-time vs historical**: Use `protect_recent_events` for "what just happened?" (instant, from websocket buffer). Use `protect_list_events` for "what happened last Tuesday?" (API query, slower)
- Smart detection types: `person`, `vehicle`, `animal`, `package`, `face`, `licensePlate`
- `min_confidence` parameter filters out low-confidence detections (default threshold: 50)
- Event types for filtering: `motion`, `smartDetectZone`, `ring`, `sensorMotion`, `sensorContact`, `sensorDoorbell`
- Time parameters use ISO 8601 format: `2026-03-17T00:00:00Z`

## Recordings

<!-- AUTO:tools:recordings -->
4 tools.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `protect_export_clip` | Read | Exports a video clip from a camera for a specified time range. |
| `protect_get_recording_status` | Read | Returns the current recording state for one or all cameras. |
| `protect_list_recordings` | Read | Returns recording availability information for a camera within a time range. |
| `protect_delete_recording` | Mutate | Attempts to delete recordings for a camera in a time range. |
<!-- /AUTO:tools:recordings -->

**Tips:**
- `protect_export_clip` produces the video on the NVR. The tool returns metadata (size, duration) — the actual video is too large for MCP
- Timelapse fps values: 4 (60x speed), 8 (120x), 20 (300x), 40 (600x)
- Channel index: 0 = high quality, 1 = medium, 2 = low
- Recording deletion is managed by the NVR's retention policy, not per-request — the delete tool returns info about this limitation

## Devices: Lights, Sensors, Chimes

<!-- AUTO:tools:devices -->
6 tools.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `protect_list_chimes` | Read | Lists all UniFi Protect chime devices with their name, connection state, volume, ring settings per camera, and available ringtones/tracks. |
| `protect_list_lights` | Read | Lists all UniFi Protect floodlight devices with their name, connection state, brightness level, PIR motion sensitivity, and paired camera. |
| `protect_list_sensors` | Read | Lists all UniFi Protect sensor devices (motion, door/window, temperature, humidity, light level, leak detection). |
| `protect_trigger_chime` | Read | Plays the chime tone on a specific chime device. |
| `protect_update_chime` | Mutate | Updates chime settings such as speaker volume (0-100), repeat times (1-6), and device name. |

| `protect_create_liveview` | Mutate | Validates input for creating a new liveview with the given name and camera IDs. |
| `protect_delete_liveview` | Mutate | Validates a liveview for deletion by ID. |
<!-- /AUTO:tools:liveviews -->

**Note:** Liveview creation and deletion must be done via the Protect web UI. These tools validate inputs but cannot perform the actual operations.

## System

<!-- AUTO:tools:system -->
4 tools.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `protect_get_firmware_status` | Read | Returns firmware update availability for the NVR and all adopted devices (cameras, lights, sensors, viewers, chimes, bridges, doorlocks). |

## Common Scenarios

### "What's happening on the cameras right now?"
1. `protect_list_cameras` → see all cameras and their status
2. `protect_recent_events` → what was just detected (instant, from buffer)
3. `protect_get_snapshot(camera_id="...", include_image=true)` → visual check

### "Was anyone detected last night?"
1. `protect_list_smart_detections(detection_type="person", start="<last night>", end="<this morning>")` → person detections
2. `protect_get_event_thumbnail(event_id="...")` → see what was detected
3. `protect_get_event(event_id="...")` → full details including confidence score

### "Export footage from the front door camera"
1. `protect_list_cameras` → find the front door camera ID
2. `protect_list_recordings(camera_id="...", start="...", end="...")` → verify footage exists
3. `protect_export_clip(camera_id="...", start="...", end="...")` → export the clip

### "Check NVR health"
```
protect_batch(tools=[
    {"tool": "protect_get_system_info"},
    {"tool": "protect_get_health"},
    {"tool": "protect_get_firmware_status"},
    {"tool": "protect_get_recording_status"}
])
```

### "A camera seems offline"
1. `protect_list_cameras` → check connection state
2. `protect_get_camera(camera_id="...")` → detailed status including IP and MAC
3. Cross-reference with Network: `unifi_lookup_by_ip(ip="<camera IP>")` → network-level status
4. If needed: `protect_reboot_camera(camera_id="...", confirm=true)` → reboot (requires permission)

---

## Important Limitations

1. **Liveview create/delete** — Not supported by the uiprotect API. Tools validate inputs but the actual operations must be done in the Protect web UI.
2. **Recording deletion** — Managed by NVR retention policy, not per-request.
3. **PTZ pan/tilt** — Only zoom is supported via the API. For pan/tilt control, use saved preset positions via `protect_ptz_preset`.
4. **Video data** — `protect_export_clip` returns metadata about the exported clip, not the video bytes (too large for MCP responses).
5. **Snapshot size** — Base64 snapshots can be large. Use width/height params to resize, or use `include_image=false` for just the reference URI.
