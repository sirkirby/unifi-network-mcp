MCP server exposing UniFi Access tools for LLMs, agents, and automation platforms. Manage doors, credentials, access policies, visitors, events, and devices -- with safe-by-default permissions and preview-before-confirm for all mutations.

## Install

### Claude Code (recommended)

The plugin installs the MCP server, an agent skill for tool discovery, and a guided setup command:

```
/plugin marketplace add sirkirby/unifi-mcp
/plugin install unifi-access@unifi-plugins
```

Then run the interactive setup to configure your controller connection:

```
/unifi-access:setup
```

This walks you through connecting to your Access controller, explains the dual-auth system (API key for reads, username/password for mutations), and configures permissions — then writes everything to `.claude/settings.json`. If you already have other UniFi plugins configured on the same controller, the setup will detect and reuse those credentials. Restart Claude Code after setup to connect.

### PyPI / Docker

```bash
# PyPI
uvx unifi-access-mcp
# or: pip install unifi-access-mcp

# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/sirkirby/unifi-access-mcp:latest

# From source
git clone https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp.git
cd unifi-mcp && uv sync
```

## Configure

Set these environment variables (or create a `.env` file). If you used `/unifi-access:setup`, this is already done.

```bash
# Server-specific variables (recommended)
UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST=192.168.1.1      # Controller IP or hostname
UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME=admin         # Local admin username
UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD=your-password # Admin password
# Optional:
# UNIFI_ACCESS_API_KEY=             # Official UniFi API key (dual auth)
# UNIFI_ACCESS_PORT=443             # Controller HTTPS port
# UNIFI_ACCESS_VERIFY_SSL=false     # SSL certificate verification
```

**Fallback:** The shared `UNIFI_*` variables (e.g., `UNIFI_HOST`) also work. The server checks for `UNIFI_ACCESS_*` first and falls back to `UNIFI_*` if the server-specific variable is not set. For single-controller setups, the shared variables are all you need.

### Dual Authentication

The Access server supports two independent auth paths:

1. **API key** -- Uses `py-unifi-access` on the dedicated Access API port (default 12445). Best for read-only queries and device listing.
2. **Local proxy session** -- Logs in via `/api/auth/login` on the UniFi OS Console (port 443) and proxies requests through `/proxy/access/api/v2/...`. Required for door lock/unlock, credential management, policies, visitors, and events.

At least one path must be configured. When both are available, each tool selects the most appropriate path. Most mutating tools require the local proxy session.

## Run

```bash
# stdio transport (default -- for Claude Desktop, LM Studio, etc.)
unifi-access-mcp

# Docker
docker run -i --rm \
  -e UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST=192.168.1.1 \
  -e UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME=admin \
  -e UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD=secret \
  ghcr.io/sirkirby/unifi-access-mcp:latest
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-access": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-access-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_USERNAME": "admin",
        "UNIFI_ACCESS_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Doors** -- list, inspect, lock/unlock, door groups, real-time status
- **Policies** -- list, inspect, update access policies and schedules
- **Credentials** -- list, inspect, create, revoke NFC cards, PINs, mobile credentials
- **Visitors** -- list, inspect, create, delete visitor passes with time-bounded access
- **Events** -- query historical events, real-time websocket buffer, activity summaries
- **Devices** -- list, inspect, reboot access hubs, readers, relays, intercoms
- **System** -- controller info, health metrics, user listing

## Agent Skills

The Claude Code plugin ships with agent skills that teach AI assistants how to work with Access effectively:

- **UniFi Access** — core skill for door control, credentials, visitors, access policies, and event monitoring. Includes guidance on the dual-auth system, real-time event streaming via WebSocket buffer, and the preview-confirm flow for physical door operations.
- **Setup** — interactive configuration wizard that walks through controller connection, credential setup, and permission configuration.

Skills are automatically available when the plugin is installed.

## Cross-Product Skills

When the Access plugin is installed alongside the **Protect plugin**, the `security-digest` skill can incorporate door events into its analysis. Badge-ins, access-denied events, and after-hours access are correlated with camera motion and alerts from Protect to produce a richer security summary across your full UniFi deployment.

No additional configuration is required — if both plugins are active, the skill automatically pulls from both servers.
