"""Event resources for UniFi Protect MCP server.

Registers an MCP resource at ``protect://events/stream`` that returns the
current contents of the websocket event buffer as a JSON array.

MCP clients can poll this resource to get the latest events without making
a tool call.  The ``protect_recent_events`` tool is an alternative for
clients that prefer tools over resources.

**Push notification limitation:**  The MCP spec defines
``notifications/resources/updated`` for server-initiated pushes, but
FastMCP's ``ServerSession.send_resource_updated(uri)`` is only accessible
during an active request context.  There is no public API for broadcasting
notifications from a background callback (e.g., websocket).  When FastMCP
adds broadcast support, we can wire EventManager._on_ws_message to push
notifications automatically.  Until then, clients should poll the resource
or use the ``protect_subscribe_events`` tool for instructions.
