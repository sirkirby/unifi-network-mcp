MCP server exposing UniFi Protect tools for LLMs, agents, and automation platforms. Query cameras, events, smart detections, recordings, lights, sensors, and chimes -- with safe-by-default permissions and preview-before-confirm for all mutations.

## Install

### Claude Code (recommended)

The plugin installs the MCP server, an agent skill for tool discovery, and a guided setup command:

```
/plugin marketplace add sirkirby/unifi-mcp
/plugin install unifi-protect@unifi-plugins
```

Then run the interactive setup to configure your controller connection:

```
/unifi-protect:setup
```

This walks you through entering your controller host, credentials, and permission preferences — then writes everything to `.claude/settings.json` so it persists across sessions. If you already have the Network plugin configured on the same controller, the setup will detect and reuse those credentials. Restart Claude Code after setup to connect.

### PyPI / Docker

```bash
# PyPI
uvx unifi-protect-mcp@latest
# or: pip install unifi-protect-mcp

# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/sirkirby/unifi-protect-mcp:latest

# From source
git clone https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-mcp.git
cd unifi-mcp && uv sync
```

## Configure

Set these environment variables (or create a `.env` file). If you used `/unifi-protect:setup`, this is already done.

```bash
# Server-specific variables (recommended)
UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST=192.168.1.1      # Controller IP or hostname
UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME=admin         # Local admin username
UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD=your-password # Admin password
# Optional:
# UNIFI_PROTECT_API_KEY=             # UniFi API key (experimental — read-only, subset of tools)
# UNIFI_PROTECT_PORT=443             # Controller HTTPS port
# UNIFI_PROTECT_VERIFY_SSL=false     # SSL certificate verification
```

**Fallback:** The shared `UNIFI_*` variables (e.g., `UNIFI_HOST`) also work. The server checks for `UNIFI_PROTECT_*` first and falls back to `UNIFI_*` if the server-specific variable is not set. For single-controller setups, the shared variables are all you need.

## Run

```bash
# stdio transport (default -- for Claude Desktop, LM Studio, etc.)
unifi-protect-mcp

# Docker
docker run -i --rm \
  -e UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST=192.168.1.1 \
  -e UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD=secret \
  ghcr.io/sirkirby/unifi-protect-mcp:latest
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi-protect": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["unifi-protect-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_HOST": "192.168.1.1",
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_USERNAME": "admin",
        "UNIFI_PROTECT_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Cameras** -- list, inspect, snapshot, RTSP streams, PTZ control, settings, recording toggle, reboot
- **Events** -- query historical events, smart detections (person/vehicle/animal/package), thumbnails
- **Real-time streaming** -- websocket event buffer with MCP resource subscriptions and polling
- **Recordings** -- status, availability, clip export with timelapse support
- **Devices** -- lights (brightness, PIR sensitivity), sensors (temperature, humidity, motion), chimes (volume, trigger)
- **Liveviews** -- list and inspect multi-camera layouts
- **System** -- NVR info, health metrics, firmware status, connected viewers

## Agent Skills

The Protect plugin ships one agent skill that works alongside the MCP tools:

### Security Digest

Cross-product event intelligence that generates a concise security summary across all connected UniFi systems.

- **Sources:** Protect camera events, Access door events, Network firewall activity
- **Severity classification:** Events are classified by time-of-day context (business hours vs. after hours vs. overnight) and event type (person detection, vehicle, door access, firewall block, etc.)
- **Cross-product correlation:** Five built-in correlation rules surface patterns that span products:
  - Motion at a door camera without a corresponding badge-in
  - Multiple failed door access attempts in a short window
  - Person detection coinciding with firewall blocks from the same timeframe
  - After-hours camera activity with no Access event
  - Repeated vehicle detections at the perimeter
- **Activity counts:** Aggregated totals across all sources for quick at-a-glance awareness

Invoke via the skill command after installing the plugin:

```
/unifi-protect:security-digest
```

## Event Improvements

### camera_name in Event Responses

All event-related tools now include `camera_name` alongside `camera_id` in every event object. The name is resolved from bootstrap data cached at startup — no extra API calls required.

Affected tools: `protect_list_events`, `protect_list_smart_detections`, `protect_recent_events`

Before:
```json
{ "camera_id": "abc123", "type": "motion", ... }
```

After:
```json
{ "camera_id": "abc123", "camera_name": "Front Door", "type": "motion", ... }
```

This eliminates the need to call `protect_list_cameras` separately just to map IDs to names.

### Compact Mode

`protect_list_events` and `protect_list_smart_detections` accept a `compact=true` parameter that strips low-signal fields from responses: `thumbnail_id`, `category`, `sub_category`, and `is_favorite`. This produces responses roughly 40% smaller.

```python
# Standard call
protect_list_events(limit=50)

# Compact — recommended for digests, summaries, and context-constrained workflows
protect_list_events(limit=50, compact=True)
```

Compact mode is the recommended default when building summaries or feeding events into downstream prompts where token budget matters.
