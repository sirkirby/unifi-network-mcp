"""CI gate: every typed resolver in type_registry has a fixture e2e test.

Phase 8 PR2 invariant: prevents Phase 6's silent-coverage gap (PR #130
ACL pattern — controller had zero rules, mutation path went unsmoked)
from recurring at the resolver level.

Each entry in ``type_registry._tool_types`` must have a corresponding
fixture test that exercises the resolver. Fixture tests declare which
tools they cover via ``# tool: <name>`` comments at module top.
