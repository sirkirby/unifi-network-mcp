"""Action dispatcher.

Resolves an MCP ``tool_name`` to a concrete domain manager method on a
per-controller manager instance and invokes it.

Architectural background
------------------------
``tools_manifest.json`` (loaded by :mod:`unifi_api.services.manifest`) does
not record which manager class / method backs each tool — it only describes
the public tool contract. To bridge the gap without modifying every tool
module or the manifest generator, this module **AST-introspects each tool
module at startup** and records the first awaited ``<runtime_singleton>.<method>(...)``
call inside each ``@server.tool()`` function. The runtime singleton's
attribute name (e.g. ``client_manager``) is then resolved per-request via
:meth:`unifi_api.services.managers.ManagerFactory.get_domain_manager`.

Trade-offs
----------
- Pure AST introspection isn't infallible. Tools that branch through multiple
  managers, or whose first manager call is conditional on ``confirm``, may
  expose only one of multiple methods. For Phase 2 / Task 12 this is
  acceptable — the dispatch surface used by Task 13 will be limited to
  read-only and simple action tools whose body has a single manager call.
- Tools whose call goes through ``await some_helper(client_manager, ...)``
  (i.e. the manager is passed as an argument rather than the receiver) are
  not captured. None of the canonical tool modules use that pattern today.

Public surface
--------------
- :class:`CapabilityMismatch`
- :func:`dispatch_action`
- :func:`build_dispatch_table` (exposed for tests)
